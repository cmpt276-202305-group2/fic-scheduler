# FIC

Meeting Minutes : meeting 2- talking with the customer and discussing needs, clarifying concerns and points of conflicts ðŸˆº

## Agenda

## Notes

- course scheduling project
- working with FIC, transfer college with sfu, more consistency, smaller class sizes
- Megan sthâ€¦ head customer

### PROBLEM

- Bunch of courses, bunch of instructors and some of them want to teach different courses
- Input each semester : excel spreadsheet , section of each courses, instructors and their availability, and how many courses they would like to teach.
- We want to match up, the most amount of interests in the courses +
- **GOAL:** get the number of set of courses,
- **Constraints:** the courses cant go at the same time as each other example( macm 101 and cmpt 125 at the same time)  
- **Constraints2:** certain courses require certain rooms, i.e (cmpt 120 would need a lab/ chem/ physics) so they need to be assigned first and they have dedicated rooms
- **Constraints3:** Some instructors would want to back to back days and back to back class sessions, that should be taken into account
- We gonna get: Instructor, the availability day for each, and their preference ( back to back , specific request)
- **Joeâ€™s constraint notes:**
  - hard constraints:
    - physical: one room can only host one course at a time, an instructor can only teach one course at a time
    - room requirements: some courses must be taught in a particular room (or set of rooms?)
    - instructor student capacity: there is a limit to students in a particular course section taught by one instructor (35 students?)
    - instructor availability: an instructor will only be available for certain time slots
    - instructor qualification: an instructor will only be qualified to teach some courses
  - soft constraints:
    - some classes shouldn't be run in the same timeslot in different rooms, because they are commonly taken by the same students in the same semester (especially if theyâ€™re both required by a particular program)
    - duress availability: some instructors may prefer to avoid particular slots, but if there is no other way to schedule course, they may be willing to work then
    - back-to-back scheduling: some instructors prefer to have assignments on either the same day or on consecutive days
    - minimum separation: some instructors may prefer not to have different teaching timeslots assigned that are consecutive without a break?
- The form is collected using <https://www.machform.com> so they might be using Google sheets internally â€“ should verify their internal data format, if Excel is just an export format then we should figure out what is easiest for them/us as an intermediate step
- We should have some kind of login/user management, but itâ€™s not the most important thing. If they use federated login we could maybe hook into it, or we could make our own thing.

## Action Items

- Getting a schedule out the first PHASE,
- Get proposals in
- Talk through the iteration
- Each iteration have a video demo 1-2 days before of the iteration due date, explaining features, and points

## Questions

- Is there a maximum number of courses an instructor can teach, independent of availability?
- Is there a fairness or work balancing consideration, where we want to make sure each instructor gets some work?
- Sometimes a bidding system is used to resolve conflicts between external entities, is that possibly desired here?
- Do we want to integrate the manual notes into our system?
