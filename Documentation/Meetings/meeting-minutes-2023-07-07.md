## Agenda

- Review screens (quick)

## Notes

- Screens :
  - Upload Preference and Availability:
    - Preferences document being added could be (no text ignore the notes) and only selection based
    - Making a rating for each day instead of yes/no  (0-5)
    - Have it work with the stated constraints in terms of availability (yes/nos)
- Maybe having all the pages for (available classrooms, available courses, list of overall instructors and their skillset) to be combined to one page called “configurations”
