## Problem Notes

### Clarification

- Lots of human level notes, ‚Äúplanning and might not‚Äù unsure states of data
- Some people are not available, but they are open to take schedulings
- Additional Comments: ? their preferences are in a really human level.

  - Ask about the workflow clarification

#####

- What platforms to use (Next.JS / React.JS)
  - Which one works the best with the JAVA and the strict frameworks/ templates we have

  - Estimation of each time will need for each features from the priority list
  - Do sprints
  - Block handling? KEY communication,

## Action Items
