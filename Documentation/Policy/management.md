Project Management

# Feature Goals (Epics)

Our project revolves around three main epics: user management and login, course and room setup, and schedule generation.
User management and login includes authentication stories such as login/logout, adding and removing users, and other necessary administrative actions.

Course and room setup includes stories involving the initial setup of the course offerings for a semester, the rooms which can be assigned, any constraints that limit which courses may be assigned to which rooms or at which time slots. This is the one-time (per semester) setup which is independent of the teacher availability.

Schedule generation includes stories involving the input of teacher availability data and other constraints or preferences expressed by the teachers, generating appropriate error messages, formatting the output for display and for distribution, and iterating on or modifying the produced schedule.

# Meeting Schedule

In our agile workflow, we're committed to maintaining consistent communication and collaboration through a blend of in-person and online meetings. On a weekly basis, we will meet once or twice in person on class days to review work completed, check velocity, and commit to future work; additionally, we are connected to a Discord group and will have additional ongoing communication there. Day-to-day project status and completion of stories and epics will be captured in the teamâ€™s Trello board for immediate feedback, and for review at meetings.
